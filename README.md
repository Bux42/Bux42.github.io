## Controls in map viewer

  

  

(Pretty similar to TM official replay editor)

  

  

| Move camera rotation | Hold Right Click + Drag |
|--|--|
| Move Camera Around | Z S Q D Keys (based your layout) |

  

  

## Plans for the future

  

Add interesting features & new ways to visualize stuff & allow users to give their own replay files to the tool
